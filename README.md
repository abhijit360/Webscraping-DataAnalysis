# Webscraping-DataAnalysis
Through this project, I want to explore webscraping, data visualisation, and data analysis. I am using Beautiful soup library to scrape the data  into a csv file.

I help to increase efficiency by 100% as I completely automated the data retrieval task for my client. In the future, I plan on assisting them visualise this data for presentation.
