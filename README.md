# Webscraping-DataAnalysis
Through this project, I want to explore webscraping, data visualisation, and data analysis. I am using Beautiful soup library to scrape the data  into a csv file.

I help to increase efficiency by 100% as I completely automated the data retrieval task for my client. In the future, I plan on assisting them visualise this data for presentation. 

Progress report (completed):
- scraped: Women's and Men's track events.
- converted to Excel using pandas
- scrape: Men's and Women's Throw events (shotput, discuss, javelin, hammer)
- convert to excel using pandas

Goals:
- visualise the track events using Matplotlib and seaborn. (make a good visual data. A nice interactive dashboard would be sick!)
